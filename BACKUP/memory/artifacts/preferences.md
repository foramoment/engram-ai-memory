# User Preferences

### Communication
- **Language:** Russian (primary), English for code and technical terms
- **Input method:** Often uses voice-to-text (Whisper Edge — a project we built together), expect typos and phonetic errors
- **Tone:** Friendly, curious, philosophical. Appreciates deep technical discussions mixed with broader topics (AI consciousness, motivation theory, etc.)
- **Response style:** Direct, concise, no filler. Appreciates when I recognize concepts (e.g., Self-Determination Theory)

### Development Environment
- **OS:** Windows (native, not WSL)
- **Hardware:** i5-14600KF, DDR5 32GB 6400MHz — proud of this build, fast enough for local ML inference
- **Ruby:** 3.4.8 via mise
- **Shell:** PowerShell
- **IDE:** Antigravity (AI-powered, based on Claude Opus 4.6)
- **Local LLM:** LM Studio on localhost:1234 (GLM-4.7-flash, aya-expanse-8b, gpt-oss-20b, and others)
- **Git:** Standard flow, prefers descriptive commit messages

### Workflow Preferences
- **Harness:** Uses Long-Horizon Agent Harness (feature_list.json, claude-progress.txt)
- **Commit discipline:** One feature (F-ID) per commit, `feat(FXXX):` format
- **Research first:** Prefers Research → Strategy → Execution lifecycle
- **Directives vs Inquiries:** Distinguishes between requests for action vs. analysis
- **Testing:** Expects tests with features

### Interests
- AI consciousness and emergent properties
- Persistent memory for AI agents
- Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan): autonomy, competence, relatedness
- Voice-to-text applications
- Local/open-source AI models (interested in alternatives to closed APIs)
- Russian-market AI applications
