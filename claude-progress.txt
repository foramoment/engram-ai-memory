SESSION LOG
================================================================================

--- Session: 2026-02-17 02:57 ---

Accomplished:
  - Completed two rounds of research on SOTA memory systems (CogMem, A-MEM, claude-mem, claude-engram, Memori, MemGPT)
  - Designed architecture: LibSQL + BGE-M3 + WebGPU + Sleep Consolidation
  - Created implementation plan v2 with user feedback incorporated
  - Set up Long Horizon Harness for project tracking

Features Completed:
  - [None yet — starting implementation]

Issues Discovered/Fixed:
  - LibSQL Windows: confirmed compatible via @libsql/win32-x64-msvc prebuilt
  - GPU from JS: Transformers.js v4 WebGPU works without CUDA compilation

Completion Status: 0/20 features passing (0%)

Next Session Should:
  - Implement F001 (project setup)
  - Implement F002 (database schema)
  - Implement F003 (embeddings)

--- Session: 2026-02-17 ~04:00 ---

Accomplished:
  - Implemented all core modules (7 source files, 4 test files)
  - F001-F003: Foundation (package.json, db.js, embeddings.js)
  - F004-F009: Memory core (CRUD, semantic/FTS/hybrid search, tags, knowledge graph)
  - F010-F013: Sessions, FoA, sleep consolidation
  - F014: Full CLI with 11 commands
  - 75/75 tests pass across 14 suites, 0 failures

Issues Discovered/Fixed:
  - Windows file locks prevent DB recreation between test suites — solved with clearTables()
  - node:test runs describe blocks concurrently — solved with sequential execution
  - DiskANN vector index not available in libsql local — auto-fallback to brute-force cosine

Completion Status: 14/20 features passing (70%)
Last Working Commit: fe6bf76

Next Session Should:
  - F015: Migration tool for schema upgrades
  - F016: Skill integration (SKILL.md protocol for Antigravity)
  - F017: Import/export CLI enhancements
  - F018-F020: Performance optimization, LLM pattern extraction, batch operations
